# Loopback-Model-Sandbox

In the `common/models/sample.js` file there is a remote method defined. It is supposed to return a non root custom model type in an array.

When you view the API explorer it shows the custom model type as a blank Object rather than the Model object. 


> See the `GET /sample/fail/{id}` endpoint to view the error
